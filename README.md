# Pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS Challenge

This project is a challenge where I created a web application using only pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS without using any frameworks or libraries. The objective was to build a semantically correct and functional web application.

## Objective

The objective of this challenge was to practice building a web application without relying on any external frameworks or libraries. The focus was on writing clean, semantic HTML, styling it with CSS, and adding interactivity and functionality with pure JavaScript.

## Project Structure

The project structure is simple and follows these conventions:

```
project/
│
├── index.html       # Main HTML file
├── css/styles.css       # CSS file for styling
└── js/script.js        # JavaScript file for functionality
```

## Testing HTML and CSS

During development, I tested HTML and CSS for semantic correctness and style using online tools such as [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) for HTML validation and [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for CSS validation.

## Running the Project

To run the project locally, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
